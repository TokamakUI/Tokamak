### Important: SwiftUI compatibility

Current Tokamak API was designed and built at the end of 2018, months before 
SwiftUI was announced. Thus, the short-term goal of Tokamak is to make the
API more compatible with SwiftUI. All contributions that help us in achieving
this goal are much appreciated. You can consider the current
Tokamak API as deprecated, but still usable for research and experimentation
purposes.
